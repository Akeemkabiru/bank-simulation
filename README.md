## Bank Simulation Tool

This command-line tool simulates a simple bank with account creation functionality. Users can create accounts, and the tool stores the account information as JSON on your end.

**Features:**

* Create new bank accounts
* Stores account information in JSON format and generate account number

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Go installed on your system (see [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install) for installation instructions)
2. **Download:**
    * Clone this repository using `git clone https://https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitHub-URL-find-use-example<username>/bank-simulation-tool.git` (replace `<username>` with your GitHub username)
    * Alternatively, you can download the zip file and extract it.
3. **Build:**
    * Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    * Run `go build` to create the executable file (`bank-sim`).

**Usage:**

* Run the tool using `./bank-simulation` (or `bank-simulation.exe` on Windows) in your terminal.

**Storing Account Information (Customization Required):**

* By default, this tool does not store account information persistently.
* To enable persistence, you can modify the code to write the account data to a JSON file of your choice.
* Look for sections in the code that handle account creation and data storage. 
* Update the file path and encoding logic as needed.

**Note:**

* This is a basic simulation tool and does not implement real banking functionalities like deposits, withdrawals, or transactions.
* Security features are not implemented.

**Further Development:**

* You can extend this tool to include additional features like:
    * Deposit and withdrawal functionalities
    * Transaction history tracking
    * Account balance display
    * Multiple account types (savings, checking, etc.)
* Implement security measures for storing user data.
